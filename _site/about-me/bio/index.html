    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <main>
      <p>Aidan Jones is a researcher, developer, and creator.</p>
<p>Jones specializes in gender and masculinities. He graduated summa cum laude from Chapman University with a B.A. in sociology. Completing a minor in music and being a member of the University Honors program also led him to place third in humanities at the National Collegiate Honors Conference for the project he co-authored <em>Stereotypical Symphonies: An Analysis of Stereotypes in Disney Soundtracks.</em> He was the co-chair of Chapman’s Sociology Club and vice-president of Chapman’s chapter of the sociology honors society Alpha Kappa Delta. He finished presenting his undergraduate thesis, <a href="/projects/soyboys"><em>Dating Soyboys: Women’s View of Veg* Men in Romantic Relationships</em></a>, in 2019 at conferences around the world.</p>
<p>He rose from the ashes of grad school rejection letters to pursue a career in web development, currently a junior web developer at <a href="https://www.unifieddistricts.com" target="_blank">Unified Districts</a>. Future-proof, clean code and intuitive, simple, creative design excite him.</p>
<p>Jones enjoys working on projects in the digital realm with his spare time. He likes to combine his interests, resulting in projects like <a href="/projects/qfld">algorithmically generated typing exercise poetry</a> and a <a href="https://www.sweetpotatosociology.com" target="_blank">video series</a> that explores topics relating to gender, music, and society.</p>
