It's weird to have press for the first time! [A story was written](https://blogs.chapman.edu/undergraduate-excellence/2019/08/29/chapman-graduate-aidan-jones-19-reflects-upon-his-journey-in-presenting-undergraduate-research/) about my most recent research and my research journey by the [Center for Undergraduate Excellence](http://chapman.edu/cue) at Chapman University.
