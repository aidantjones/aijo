### _Dating Soyboys: Women's View of Veg\* Men in Romantic Relationships_
 - Undergraduate Thesis
 - **Main Findings:** Most women tended to view veg\* diets as a masculine strength and an indicator of kindness, a concept I dub strong-kindness. With strong-kindness, this version of ideal masculinity moves a little more into the feminine side while still remaining firmly within the masculine part of the binary.
- **Advisor:** Dr. Edson Cruz
