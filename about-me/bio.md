Aidan Jones is a researcher, developer, and creator.

Jones specializes in gender and masculinities. He graduated summa cum laude from Chapman University with a B.A. in sociology. Completing a minor in music and being a member of the University Honors program also led him to place third in humanities at the National Collegiate Honors Conference for the project he co-authored _Stereotypical Symphonies: An Analysis of Stereotypes in Disney Soundtracks._ He was the co-chair of Chapman’s Sociology Club and vice-president of Chapman’s chapter of the sociology honors society Alpha Kappa Delta. He finished presenting his undergraduate thesis, [_Dating Soyboys: Women’s View of Veg* Men in Romantic Relationships_](/projects/soyboys), in 2019 at conferences around the world.

He rose from the ashes of grad school rejection letters to pursue a career in web development, currently a junior web developer at [Unified Districts](https://www.unifieddistricts.com). Future-proof, clean code and intuitive, simple, creative design excite him.

Jones enjoys working on projects in the digital realm with his spare time. He likes to combine his interests, resulting in projects like [algorithmically generated typing exercise poetry](/projects/qfld) and a [video series](https://www.sweetpotatosociology.com) that explores topics relating to gender, music, and society.
